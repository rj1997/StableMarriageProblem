# Stable Marriage Problem

Given *n* men and *n* women, where each person has ranked all members of the opposite sex in order of preference, marry the men and women together such that there are no two people of opposite sex who would both rather have each other than their current partners. When there are no such pairs of people, the set of marriages is deemed stable. The most counter-intutive thing is that there always exist a solution to this problem.

The solution to the problem is done by Galeâ€“Shapley algorithm, which states, till all engagements are done, repeat this loop.
1. Each still not engaged woman sends a proposal to the best suitor of her preference list, to commmit an engagement.
2. Any man who receives a proposal, looks up into his preference list and accepts from the one with the most preference, and rejects all of them.

*Remember, engagements are temporary in nature, i.e., if a man gets a proposal from a better woman than what he is currently engaged to, he will happily call off the engagement.*

# About the Project
The project implements the basic Gale-Shapley algorithm presented in the paper in 1962. Two text files *mp.txt* and *fp.txt* refer to male and female preferences respectively.
 
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Clone the repo using 
```
git clone https://github.com/rj1997/StableMarriageProblem.git
```

### Prerequisites

Python3 will do.

## Running the tests

To run each simulation use the following command from terminal:

```
python3 stablemarriageproblem.py
```

## Contributing

The work is still in progress, I will add more functionalities to this algorithm in some time.
